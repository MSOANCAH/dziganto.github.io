## What is a Data Scientist?

Five simple words that when uttered in sequence conjure fierce and ceaseless debate. You're likely to hear opinions like:
- *"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician."* 
- *"A data scientist is someone with math and stats knowledge, domain expertise, and hacking skills."* 
- *"A data scientist is a statistician who lives in San Francisco."* 

Run a Google search. You'll find innumerable opinions on the matter. In fact, you can spend an hour, an afternoon, or probably even a week engrossed in this mind numbing task. 

And it never ends. It seems every week there's a new post about what a data scientist is and what a data scientist is not. Some weeks you have to be an expert in Statistics and others you have to know Scala. Some weeks you have to be an expert in software development, machine learning, big data technologies, and visualization tools. And some weeks you have to actually know how to talk to people and clearly articulate your ideas in addition to all the other technical skills. Every week I read these posts, and every week I cringe. 

 ## The Myth of Boxes

Maybe it's human nature or maybe it's elitism but these posts revolve around this idea that you can place people into metaphorical boxes. One box is labeled **Not Data Scientist** and the other **Data Scientist**. Where and how you decide to draw the line determines which people go into which boxes. 

With that in mind, allow me to propose an unoriginal idea: that one's experiences bias one's worldview. For example, I am a visual and kinesthetic learner, have to build everything from scratch to truly understand it, have a Master's degree from a highly regarded university, and prefer to work alone initially on a new project until I've fleshed out my own ideas and am ready to share with the group. Therefore, it's easy for me to assume every data scientist is highly visual and kinesthetic. It's easy for me to assume every data scientist should build everything from scratch. It's easy for me to assume every data scientist should have a Master's or PhD from a reputable university. It's easy to assume every data scientist should flesh out their own ideas before collaborating. I mean, I'm a data scientist. I know what it takes. Right?

This is lazy thinking - a mental shortcut if you will. To assume everyone must have the same experience as me is myopic. The world is chock full of humanity's most difficult problems and solutions aren't going to come from a homogeneous group. We need fresh ideas, open lines of communication, and inclusion. We need to shift our thinking.

## A Shift in Thinking

Rather than focusing on who we should admit into our special club and who we should exclude, let's focus on how to bring more people into the fold. And rather than arguing about which algorithms, which tools, and which programming languages someone should know, let's focus our energy on real problems. 

Because people are not boxes. People don't magically morph from non data scientist to data scientist. **It's not quantum; it's spectral.**

Let me say that again: **Data science is a spectrum.** 

Let that sink in. Seriously. 

Where or if an organization draws the line is its prerogative. Some organizations have clear needs with regards to skills while others are more fuzzy. Some organizations distinguish data scientists of varying skill with adjectives like *junior* or *principal* while some organizations don't even confer the title data scientist, though individuals surely do data science there. You needn't get bogged down in this. 

## Back To The Question
Ever look at a data science pipeline? It can take many forms but it usually breaks down into something like this: ask a question, generate some hypotheses, collect data, see if any of your hypotheses have merit, make refinements, and repeat. Hmm, sounds an awful lot like the Scientific Method. Maybe this term *data science* is really just a rebranding of this idea. Sure, we use fancy new tools and bandy about buzzwords like *machine learning* and *big data*, but let's not fool ourselves. It's just math and science at the core. 

So if you follow these simple steps to quantitatively drive your decisions, then I have news for you: you're absolutely doing some level of data science. Doesn't matter if you're generating a report of descriptive statistics for you boss, predicting the next trend on Twitter, or developing a bleeding edge machine learning algorithm in the lab.

## Now What?
If you're new to data science, don't fret. Just get started. It doesn't even really matter where. Want to learn Python? Dip your toe in by taking that introductory class. Curious about Statistics? Check out Khan Academy videos. Want to learn from those in the know? Read a blog. Go to a Meetup. Get involved.  

And if you're a grizzled veteran, share your expertise by blogging, creating tutorials, speaking locally, mentoring newcomers, or contributing in whatever way makes sense for you. 

The big takeaway is that regardless of your current skill set, regardless of you gender or race or anything else for that matter, you can learn, share, and contribute to data science. The field is sprawling. There's room for everyone. 

I'll leave you with two items: 
1. A great [article](https://brohrer.github.io/one_step_program_become_data_scientist.html) by Brandon Rohrer about how to become a data scientist that I couldn't agree with more
2. A famous quote from Mark Twain:
>“The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.”
