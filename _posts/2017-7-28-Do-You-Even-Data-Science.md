## What is a Data Scientist?

Four simple words that when uttered in exact sequence conjure fierce and ceaseless debate. You're likely to hear things like:
- *"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician."* 
- *"A data scientist is someone with math and stats knowledge, domain expertise, and hacking skills."* 
- *"A data scientist is a statistician who lives in San Francisco."* 

Run a Google search. You'll find loads of responses. In fact, you can spend an hour, an afternoon, or probably even a week on this mind numbing task. 

It seems every week there's a new post about what a data scientist is and what a data scientist is not. Some weeks you have to be an expert in Apache Spark and others you have to know Scala. Some weeks you have to be an expert in software development, machine learning, and visualization. And some weeks you have to actually know how to talk to people and clearly articulate your ideas. Every week I read these posts and every week I cringe. 

 ## The Myth of Boxes

Maybe it's human nature or maybe it's an ego thing but these posts revolve around this idea that you can place people into metaphorical boxes. One box is labeled *Not Data Scientist* and the other *Data Scientist*. Where and how you decide to draw the line determines which people go into which boxes. 

Allow me to go so far as to propose that one's experience biases one's worldview. For example, I am highly skewed towards visual and kinesthetic learning, have to build everything from scratch to truly understand it, have a Master's degree from a highly regarded university, and prefer to work alone on a project until I've fleshed out my own ideas and am ready to share with the group. Therefore, it's easy to assume every data scientist is highly visual and kinesthetic. It's easy to assume every data scientist should build everything from scratch. It's easy to assume every data scientist should have a Master's degree or above from a prestigious university. It's easy to assume every data scientist should work alone on a project initially. I mean, I'm a data scientist. I know what it takes. Right?

This is lazy thinking, a mental shortcut if you will. To assume everyone must have the same experience as me is myopic. The world is chock full of humanity's most difficult problems. Solutions aren't going to come from a homogeneous group. We need fresh ideas, open lines of communication, and inclusion.

## A Shift in Thinking

Rather than focusing on who we should admit to our special club and who we should exclude, let's focus on how to bring more people into the fold. Rather than arguing about which algorithms, which tools, and which programming languages someone should know, let's change the way we think. 

People are not boxes. People don't magically morph from non data scientist to data scientist. **It's not quantum; it's spectral.**
