## What is a data scientist?

Four simple words that when uttered in exact sequence conjure fierce and ceaseless debate. You're likely to hear things like:
- *"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician."* 
- *"A data scientist is someone with math and stats knowledge, domain expertise, and hacking skills."* 
- *"A data scientist is a statistician who lives in San Francisco."* 

Run a Google search. You'll find loads of responses. In fact, you can spend an hour, an afternoon, or probably even a week on this mind numbing task. 

It seems every week there's a new post about what a data scientist is and what a data scientist is not. Some weeks you have to be an expert in Apache Spark and others you have to know Scala. Some weeks you have to be an expert in software development, machine learning, and visualization. And some weeks you have to actually know how to talk to people and clearly articulate your ideas. Every week I read these posts and every week I cringe.
